# Night-Vision-Security-Patrolling-Robot-with-Live-Streaming
This robot can be used in patrolling places where a person is not safe to stay or walk This is especially useful at night as this has an night vision camera That is it can clearly see during the night or any dark place using IR Blasters 
This also features live streaming of the camera so  this can also be used in rescue operation or any other activities.
This is done using DC motors, a chassis and the brain of the entire system is Raspberry pi 
The 2 boards will be working synchronised with each other

can create a night vision security patrolling robot using Raspberry Pi, a night vision camera, and DC motors. For live streaming, we can use Flask to create a simple web server.

//Requirements//
1.Raspberry Pi (with Raspbian OS installed)
2.Raspberry Pi Camera Module (with night vision capabilities)
3.DC Motors and Motor Driver Board (L298N or similar)
4.Chassis
5.Flask (for live streaming)
6.OpenCV (for camera handling)
7.RPi.GPIO (for motor control)
